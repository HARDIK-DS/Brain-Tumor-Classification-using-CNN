# 🧠 Brain Tumor Classification using CNN

This project uses **Deep Learning** techniques, specifically **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, to automatically classify **MRI brain scans** into four categories — **Glioma**, **Meningioma**, **Pituitary**, and **No Tumor**. The model was implemented using **PyTorch** and achieved an impressive **~99% test accuracy** through effective preprocessing, data augmentation, and model optimization.
